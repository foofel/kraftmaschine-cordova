[next todo]
- fix temp updater in the esp32 ble server
- check for bad i2c values through the long cable 
- finish the ble setup and program init setup steps
- finish at least bm1k/2k/twinpeaks board (need a better name)
- loading screen of reduce timeout for initial login
- top spacing in menu bar
- 


[needed before release]
- hardware solution for:
    - faster caseing production (cutting right holes)
    - faster pcb creation (either pdb layout or better streifenraster platine)
    - the dsub buchs work good but we need a better and cheap housing
    - make scale/bme280 interfhangeable secure (use lower pins for bme280)
- buy and find aplace for a 3d printer or check printing cost


[experiments]
- when is the data from x711 really ready? save timestamp and print on serial

[other]
- setup wiki.js (or look for another but we need a wiki)

























































[training sessions]
- make nice graphs for hold size/train weight/percentage weight

[battle]
- like seasons, resetting each month/week or seasons-
- various categories hangtime/holdsize/both (think of a key on how to weight this)
- direct battle, e.g. increating weight or hangtimer alternating between two people

[benchmark]


[highscore]


[general]


[nessesary]
# easy
+++++ next +++++
    beim benchmark muss der keepalive im intervall erneruert werden während der benchmark läuft, das sollte mit dem start/error vom controller irgendwie gehen, danach die letzten punkte hierdrunter
- highlight your own best time on goal bar
- show self best on goal clock [maybe done]
- fix "custom benchmark" directly visivle at hole selection

[easy]
- leave/join channel uppon pause/resume
- ++ optional ++ friend thingy?
[medium]
- highlight friends on goal bar / goal timer (red?)
- dont show expert mode on backend error
- persistent saves (not local storage, that only for debugging)
- add qr code gen page/scan
- nicer colors for left/right selection. more dignified
- allow some routes to keep the previus content
- scale: hide weight until initial tare is done
- add qr code generation/scanning for firnd/board selection/adding
- add general "options" thingy for the config stuff so the user can modify it
- add graph to highscore detail results
- set beep delay(beep sound on off etc.) directly on the timer via gear icon in the lower left
- the whole scale callback thingy neets to be more... flexible e.g. after the tare the scale should allow for 
- timer should "wait" a specific time (e.g. 2s) if the user is no in the activation time zone on change to the active state
    becase we want not to measure how "exact" he can start but if he can hang the whole duration
- need some kind of auth for clients for the websocket backend otherwise its easy to ddos and maybe some kind of keepalive (already ping/pong??)
[hard]
- add "schnellkraft" test via pullup
- add some stuff to the debug view
- "perks"/achivbements e.g. hang a minute, have a valid hang on 10mm etc. (visible opn user profile page)
- add perks
    - 1 training
    - 10 trainings
    - 100 trainings
    - 10 trainings in a week
    - ...
- select board from map?
